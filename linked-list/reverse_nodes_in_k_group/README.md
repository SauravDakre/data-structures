25. Reverse Nodes in k-Group

https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-nodes-in-k-group/


Given a linked list, reverse the nodes of a linked list k at a time and return its modified list.

k is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of k then left-out nodes, in the end, should remain as it is.

You may not alter the values in the list's nodes, only nodes themselves may be changed.

Example: 1
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 3
Output: [3,2,1,4,5]
